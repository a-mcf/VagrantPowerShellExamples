## Vagrant basics
- Create a new vagrant file `vagrant init a-mcf/Win2012R2-WMF5-min`
- Where do images come from? [Packer](https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html).
- Images can be hosted for free on [Vagrant Cloud]( https://vagrantcloud.com/) (formerly Atlas).
- This demo uses an image built from Matt Wrock's WMF5 [box](https://github.com/mwrock/packer-templates)
- Credentials are customarily `vagrant/vagrant`
- Vagrant uses a shared folder mounted inside the guest at `c:\vagrant` or `/vagrant` to get files into the guest.
- It uses WinRM or SSH for communication `vagrant powershell` or `vagrant ssh`
- Basic commands:
  - `vagrant up` - downloads (if required) and boots the box, running provisioners as required.
  - `vagrant reload` - reboots the box.
  - `vagrant halt` - shuts down the box
  - `vagrant provision` - runs the provisioners in the Vagrantfile witout rebooting.
  - `vagrant destroy` - destroys the box
